## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to show trends in weather data on the island of Oahu to present to W. Avy, the primary potential investor in a new surf shop on the island. Mr. Avy is concerned that colder weather will deter patrons from the surf shop, thus making investing in the surf shop a poor financial decision. By compiling weather data from the past number of years and identifying trends, I hope to convince Mr. Avy of the prudence and lack of risk in investing in this surf shop.

## Results
- The island's minumum and maxiumum temperatures do not vary much between summer and winter months. The minimum temperature in June, for example, is 64 degrees, while in December, it is 56. On the other end, the maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees, while in June it reaches just a bit higher to 85.
- There is even less variance in the average temperature between the two months studied. The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, while in December, it is 71.0.
- There is not much change in standard deviation between the two months. In December, the standard deviation from the mean is 3.75, while in June it is 3.26.
